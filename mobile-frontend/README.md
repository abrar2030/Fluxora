# Mobile-Frontend Directory

## Overview

The `mobile-frontend` directory contains the mobile application frontend for the Fluxora energy forecasting platform. This directory houses the React Native codebase that powers the Fluxora mobile experience on iOS and Android devices.

## Purpose

The mobile frontend serves as a portable interface to the Fluxora platform, allowing users to:

- View energy consumption dashboards
- Access forecasting predictions
- Analyze energy usage patterns
- Configure settings and preferences
- Receive alerts and notifications

## Structure

The mobile frontend follows a standard React Native project structure, organized to promote maintainability and scalability. Key directories and files include:

- **src/**: Source code for the application
  - **components/**: Reusable UI components
  - **screens/**: Screen components for different app sections
  - **navigation/**: Navigation configuration
  - **services/**: API and backend service integrations
  - **utils/**: Utility functions and helpers
  - **assets/**: Images, icons, and other static assets
  - **styles/**: Shared styles and theming
- **tests/**: Unit and integration tests
- **android/**: Android-specific configuration
- **ios/**: iOS-specific configuration
- **App.js**: Main application entry point

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version)
- npm or yarn
- React Native CLI
- Android Studio (for Android development)
- Xcode (for iOS development)
- Expo CLI (if using Expo)

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd mobile-frontend
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start

# Run on Android
npm run android

# Run on iOS
npm run ios
```

### Development Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from the main branch
2. Implement the feature or fix
3. Write tests for the new code
4. Run the test suite to ensure all tests pass
5. Submit a pull request for review

## Testing

The mobile frontend includes a comprehensive testing strategy:

- **Unit Tests**: For testing individual components and functions
- **Integration Tests**: For testing component interactions
- **End-to-End Tests**: For testing complete user flows

Run tests using:

```bash
npm test
```

## Building for Production

To build the application for production:

```bash
# Android
npm run build:android

# iOS
npm run build:ios
```

## Integration with Backend

The mobile frontend integrates with the Fluxora backend through:

- RESTful API calls
- WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- Push notification services

## Design System

The mobile frontend follows a consistent design system that includes:

- Typography guidelines
- Color palette
- Component styling
- Responsive design principles
- Accessibility considerations

## Performance Considerations

To ensure optimal performance:

- Minimize bundle size
- Implement code splitting
- Optimize image assets
- Use memoization for expensive calculations
- Implement virtualized lists for large datasets

## Related Components

The mobile frontend interacts with:

- **Backend API**: For data retrieval and updates
- **Authentication Services**: For user authentication
- **Analytics**: For usage tracking and analysis
