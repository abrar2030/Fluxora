# Notebooks Directory

## Overview

The `notebooks` directory contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, analysis, model development, and visualization in the Fluxora energy forecasting platform. These notebooks serve as interactive documents that combine code, visualizations, and explanatory text to support the data science workflow.

## Purpose

The notebooks in this directory serve several important purposes:

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of energy consumption data
- Feature engineering experimentation
- Model prototyping and evaluation
- Result visualization and reporting
- Documentation of data science methodologies
- Knowledge sharing and collaboration

## Structure

The notebooks directory should be organized by purpose or workflow stage:

- **exploration/**: Initial data exploration notebooks
- **preprocessing/**: Data cleaning and feature engineering notebooks
- **modeling/**: Model development and evaluation notebooks
- **visualization/**: Result visualization and reporting notebooks
- **tutorials/**: Educational notebooks for onboarding new team members

## Usage

### Running Notebooks

To work with the notebooks:

1. Ensure you have Jupyter installed in your environment
2. Navigate to the notebooks directory
3. Start the Jupyter server
4. Open the desired notebook

```bash
# From the project root
cd notebooks
jupyter notebook
# or
jupyter lab
```

### Development Workflow

When developing new notebooks:

1. Create a new notebook with a descriptive name
2. Document the purpose and methodology in markdown cells
3. Write clean, well-commented code
4. Include visualizations to illustrate findings
5. Summarize results and conclusions

## Best Practices

When working with notebooks:

1. **Naming Convention**: Use clear, descriptive names with date prefixes if relevant
2. **Documentation**: Include markdown cells explaining the purpose and methodology
3. **Code Quality**: Write clean, modular code with appropriate comments
4. **Output Management**: Clear outputs before committing to version control
5. **Environment**: Document dependencies and environment requirements
6. **Reproducibility**: Ensure notebooks can be run from start to finish
7. **Version Control**: Use notebook-specific version control tools if needed

## Integration with Other Components

The notebooks directory integrates with:

- **Data**: For accessing raw and processed data
- **Src**: For importing shared code and utilities
- **Config**: For accessing configuration parameters
- **Models**: For saving and loading trained models

## Converting to Production Code

When moving from notebook experiments to production:

1. Refactor notebook code into modular Python scripts
2. Move functions to appropriate modules in the `src` directory
3. Implement proper error handling and logging
4. Add unit tests for all functionality
5. Document the API and usage
