# Src Directory

## Overview

The `src` directory contains the core source code for the Fluxora energy forecasting platform. This directory houses the main application logic, algorithms, and utilities that power the platform's energy forecasting capabilities.

## Purpose

The source code in this directory serves as the foundation of the Fluxora platform, providing:

- Core data processing pipelines
- Machine learning model implementations
- Feature engineering utilities
- API implementations
- Business logic services
- Shared utilities and helpers

## Structure

The src directory follows a modular, domain-driven design approach, organized into logical components:

```

│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── app.py
│   ├── routes/
│   └── middleware/

```

## Key Components

### API

The API module provides RESTful endpoints for interacting with the Fluxora platform, including:

- Data ingestion endpoints
- Forecasting endpoints
- Model management endpoints
- User management endpoints

### Data

The data module handles all aspects of data management:

- Data ingestion from various sources
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Data validation and quality checks
- Data transformation and normalization

### Features

The features module manages feature engineering and selection:

- Time series feature extraction
- Feature transformation
- Feature selection algorithms
- Feature store integration

### Models

The models module contains machine learning model implementations:

- Model training pipelines
- Model evaluation utilities
- Inference engines
- Model versioning and management

### Utils

The utils module provides shared utilities used across the application:

- Logging configuration
- Configuration management
- Validation utilities
- Common helper functions

### Services

The services module implements business logic services:

- Forecasting services
- Notification services
- Integration services
- Background processing services

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Required packages listed in requirements.txt
- Development environment set up according to SETUP_GUIDE.md

### Development Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from the main branch
2. Implement the feature or fix
3. Write tests for the new code
4. Run the test suite to ensure all tests pass
5. Submit a pull request for review

## Testing

The source code includes comprehensive testing:

- Unit tests for individual functions and classes
- Integration tests for component interactions
- End-to-end tests for complete workflows

Run tests using pytest:

```bash
# From the project root
pytest src/
```

## Best Practices

When working with the source code:

1. **Code Style**: Follow PEP 8 and project-specific style guidelines
2. **Documentation**: Document all functions, classes, and modules
3. **Testing**: Write tests for all new functionality
4. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling and logging
5. **Type Hints**: Use type hints to improve code readability and IDE support
6. **Modularity**: Keep functions and classes focused on a single responsibility

## Related Components

The src directory integrates with:

- **Config**: For application configuration
- **Data**: For data storage and retrieval
- **Packages**: For shared libraries and utilities
- **Apps**: For application-specific implementations
