# Infrastructure Directory

## Overview

The `infrastructure` directory contains Infrastructure as Code (IaC) configurations and scripts for provisioning and managing the cloud resources required by the Fluxora energy forecasting platform. This directory enables consistent, repeatable deployment of the infrastructure components that support the Fluxora system.

## Purpose

The infrastructure code in this directory serves several key purposes:

- Automate the provisioning of cloud resources
- Ensure consistency across different environments (development, staging, production)
- Enable infrastructure version control
- Facilitate disaster recovery
- Support scaling operations
- Document the infrastructure requirements

## Structure

This directory should contain infrastructure definitions for various cloud providers and services that support the Fluxora platform. The specific files and organization will depend on the cloud providers and IaC tools being used, such as Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, or Pulumi.

## Best Practices

When working with the infrastructure code:

1. **Version Control**: Always commit infrastructure changes to version control
2. **Testing**: Test infrastructure changes in a development environment before applying to production
3. **Documentation**: Document any manual steps or configurations not covered by the IaC
4. **Secrets Management**: Never store sensitive information like access keys in the infrastructure code
5. **Modularity**: Organize infrastructure code into reusable modules
6. **State Management**: Use appropriate state management for your IaC tool
7. **Tagging**: Apply consistent tagging to resources for cost tracking and management

## Deployment Workflow

The typical workflow for deploying infrastructure changes:

1. Make changes to the infrastructure code
2. Review changes with team members
3. Apply changes to a development environment
4. Test the changes
5. Apply changes to staging environment
6. Verify functionality in staging
7. Apply changes to production during a maintenance window
8. Verify production functionality

## Integration with CI/CD

Infrastructure deployment can be integrated with CI/CD pipelines:

1. Infrastructure validation on pull requests
2. Automated deployment to development environments
3. Approval gates for production changes
4. Rollback capabilities for failed deployments

## Related Components

The infrastructure directory integrates with:

- **Deployments**: For application deployment configurations
- **Monitoring**: For setting up monitoring infrastructure
- **Config**: For environment-specific configurations

## Security Considerations

When managing infrastructure:

- Follow the principle of least privilege for IAM roles and permissions
- Implement network security best practices
- Enable appropriate logging and monitoring
- Regularly review and update security configurations
- Implement infrastructure security scanning

## Disaster Recovery

The infrastructure should include provisions for disaster recovery:

- Regular backups of critical data
- Multi-region redundancy where appropriate
- Documented recovery procedures
- Tested recovery processes

## Contributing

When contributing to the infrastructure code:

1. Follow the project's infrastructure coding standards
2. Document all changes thoroughly
3. Test changes in isolation before integration
4. Coordinate with the team for changes that affect shared resources
