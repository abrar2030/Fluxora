# Monitoring Directory

## Overview

The `monitoring` directory contains configurations, scripts, and resources for monitoring the health, performance, and availability of the Fluxora energy forecasting platform. This directory provides the necessary tools to ensure the system operates reliably and efficiently.

## Purpose

The monitoring system serves several critical purposes:

- Track system health and performance metrics
- Detect and alert on anomalies or failures
- Provide visibility into system behavior
- Support capacity planning and optimization
- Enable proactive maintenance
- Assist with troubleshooting and root cause analysis

## Structure

The monitoring directory should contain configurations for various monitoring tools and services that support the Fluxora platform. This may include:

- Metrics collection configurations
- Dashboard definitions
- Alert rules and notification settings
- Log aggregation configurations
- Health check scripts
- Performance testing tools

## Key Monitoring Areas

The monitoring system should cover these key areas:

### Infrastructure Monitoring
- CPU, memory, disk, and network usage
- Cloud resource utilization
- Container health and performance
- Database performance and availability

### Application Monitoring
- API response times and error rates
- Request throughput and latency
- Background job performance
- Cache hit rates and efficiency

### Model Monitoring
- Prediction accuracy and drift
- Feature distribution changes
- Model training performance
- Inference latency

### Business Metrics
- User engagement metrics
- Forecast accuracy over time
- System usage patterns
- Key performance indicators

## Integration with Alerting

The monitoring system should integrate with alerting mechanisms:

- Define alert thresholds for critical metrics
- Configure notification channels (email, SMS, chat)
- Implement alert escalation policies
- Create on-call schedules for incident response

## Dashboards

Monitoring dashboards should provide:

- Real-time system overview
- Historical performance trends
- Drill-down capabilities for troubleshooting
- Custom views for different stakeholders

## Best Practices

When working with the monitoring system:

1. **Meaningful Metrics**: Focus on actionable, business-relevant metrics
2. **Appropriate Granularity**: Balance detail with storage and performance costs
3. **Correlation**: Enable correlation between related metrics and logs
4. **Baseline Establishment**: Define normal behavior to detect anomalies
5. **Documentation**: Document alert meanings and response procedures
6. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and refine monitoring configurations

## Related Components

The monitoring directory integrates with:

- **Infrastructure**: For collecting infrastructure metrics
- **Logs**: For log aggregation and analysis
- **Deployments**: For deployment health monitoring
- **All Application Components**: As monitoring targets
