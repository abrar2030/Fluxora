| **Isolation Forest** | Anomaly detection | Effective for identifying outliers in high-dimensional data |

To train models:

```bash
cd src/models
python train.py --config=configs/lstm_config.yaml
```

Model performance metrics are tracked using MLflow and can be viewed at http://localhost:5000 when running locally.
