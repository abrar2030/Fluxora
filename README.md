## ⚙️ Configuration

Modify `config/config.yaml`:
```yaml
model:
  production_threshold: 0.85  # Minimum accuracy for deployment
  drift:
    threshold: 0.15           # Data drift alert level

feature_store:
  offline_store: s3://energy-data/features
  online_store: redis://redis:6379

api:
  rate_limit: "100/minute"
```

## 🤖 Model Versioning
```python
from src.models.model_versioning import promote_model

# Promote best performing model
promote_model(
    run_id="a1b2c3d4", 
    validation_metric="mae",
    threshold=0.45
)
```

## 🔍 Data Validation
```python
from src.data.data_validator import validate_energy_data

# Validate incoming data
validation_report = validate_energy_data(
    df, 
    expectation_suite="energy_suite"
)

if not validation_report.success:
    handle_invalid_data(validation_report)
```
