# Web-Frontend Directory

## Overview

The `web-frontend` directory contains the web application frontend for the Fluxora energy forecasting platform. This directory houses the React-based codebase that powers the Fluxora web interface, providing users with a rich, interactive experience for energy data visualization and forecasting.

## Purpose

The web frontend serves as the primary user interface to the Fluxora platform, allowing users to:

- View comprehensive energy consumption dashboards
- Access and interpret forecasting predictions
- Analyze historical energy usage patterns
- Configure system settings and user preferences
- Interact with data visualizations and reports

## Structure

The web frontend follows a modern React project structure, organized to promote maintainability and scalability:

```

## Technology Stack

The web frontend is built with:

- **React**: UI library for component-based development
- **Vite**: Build tool for fast development and optimized production builds
- **CSS/SCSS**: For styling components
- **Jest**: Testing framework
- **React Testing Library**: For component testing
- **Axios/Fetch**: For API communication

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (LTS version)
- npm or yarn
- Git

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd web-frontend
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### Development Workflow

1. Create a feature branch from the main branch
2. Implement the feature or fix
3. Write tests for the new code
4. Run the test suite to ensure all tests pass
5. Submit a pull request for review

## Testing

The web frontend includes a comprehensive testing strategy:

- **Unit Tests**: For testing individual components and functions
- **Integration Tests**: For testing component interactions
- **End-to-End Tests**: For testing complete user flows

Run tests using:

```bash
npm test
```

## Building for Production

To build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

This creates optimized files in the `dist/` directory, ready for deployment.

## Integration with Backend

The web frontend integrates with the Fluxora backend through:

- RESTful API calls defined in `utils/api.js`
- Data services that transform and prepare data for presentation

## Design System

The web frontend follows a consistent design system that includes:

- Typography guidelines
- Color palette defined in `theme.js`
- Component styling patterns
- Responsive design principles
- Accessibility considerations

## Performance Considerations

To ensure optimal performance:

- Code splitting for reduced initial load time
- Lazy loading of components and routes
- Optimized asset loading
- Memoization for expensive calculations
- Efficient state management

## Related Components

The web frontend interacts with:

- **Backend API**: For data retrieval and updates
- **Authentication Services**: For user authentication
- **Analytics**: For usage tracking and analysis
