# Fluxora Project Overview

## Introduction
Fluxora is a comprehensive project that appears to be a full-stack application with machine learning capabilities. The project follows a well-organized structure with separate components for frontend, backend, infrastructure, and data processing.

## Project Structure
- `frontend/`: User interface components
- `src/`: Backend and core application logic
- `infrastructure/`: Infrastructure and deployment configurations
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and ML experiments
- `monitoring/`: System monitoring and logging
- `config/`: Configuration files
- `deployments/`: Deployment-related files
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts
- `docs/`: Project documentation

## Key Components
1. **Frontend**: Web-based user interface
2. **Backend**: Core application logic and API services
3. **Infrastructure**: Cloud and deployment configurations
4. **Data Processing**: ML and data analysis capabilities
5. **Monitoring**: System health and performance tracking

## Technology Stack
- Python (based on requirements.txt)
- DVC for data version control
- Git for version control
- Make for build automation
- Shell scripts for automation

## Development Workflow
1. Development environment setup
2. Code changes and testing
3. Version control and documentation
4. Deployment and monitoring
