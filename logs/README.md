# Logs Directory

## Overview

The `logs` directory is designated for storing log files generated by the Fluxora energy forecasting platform. This directory serves as a centralized location for application logs, making it easier to monitor system behavior, troubleshoot issues, and analyze performance.

## Purpose

The logs directory serves several important purposes:

- Provides a consistent location for all application logs
- Facilitates log aggregation and analysis
- Supports debugging and troubleshooting
- Enables performance monitoring and optimization
- Assists with audit trails and compliance requirements

## Usage

### Log File Organization

Log files should be organized by component and date, following this recommended structure:

```
logs/
├── api/
│   ├── api-YYYY-MM-DD.log
│   └── error-YYYY-MM-DD.log
├── model/
│   ├── training-YYYY-MM-DD.log
│   └── prediction-YYYY-MM-DD.log
├── data/
│   ├── ingestion-YYYY-MM-DD.log
│   └── processing-YYYY-MM-DD.log
└── system/
    └── system-YYYY-MM-DD.log
```

### Log Rotation

To prevent logs from consuming excessive disk space, log rotation should be implemented:

- Daily rotation based on date
- Size-based rotation when files exceed a certain size
- Compression of older log files
- Automatic deletion of logs older than a specified retention period

### Log Levels

Logs should use appropriate severity levels:

- **ERROR**: Errors that prevent normal operation
- **WARNING**: Issues that don't prevent operation but require attention
- **INFO**: General information about system operation
- **DEBUG**: Detailed information for debugging purposes

## Integration with Monitoring

The logs directory integrates with the monitoring system:

- Log files can be parsed by log aggregation tools
- Metrics can be extracted from logs for monitoring dashboards
- Alerts can be triggered based on log patterns

## Best Practices

When working with logs:

1. **Structured Logging**: Use structured logging formats (JSON) where possible
2. **Sensitive Information**: Never log sensitive information (passwords, tokens, etc.)
3. **Contextual Information**: Include relevant context in log messages
4. **Consistency**: Use consistent log formats across all components
5. **Performance**: Be mindful of logging volume in production environments
6. **Backup**: Implement backup strategies for critical logs

## Log Management

For effective log management:

- Regularly review logs for patterns and issues
- Implement automated log analysis where possible
- Establish log retention policies based on compliance requirements
- Document logging standards for developers

## Security Considerations

When managing logs:

- Protect log files with appropriate permissions
- Consider encryption for logs containing sensitive information
- Implement secure log transmission when aggregating logs
- Establish access controls for log viewing and analysis

## Related Components

The logs directory interacts with:

- **Monitoring**: For log aggregation and analysis
- **All Application Components**: As log producers

For more information on logging standards and practices, refer to the `DEVELOPMENT_GUIDELINES.md` file in the `docs` directory.
