# Packages Directory

## Overview

The `packages` directory contains reusable code packages and libraries that are shared across different components of the Fluxora energy forecasting platform. This directory follows a modular approach to software development, promoting code reuse, maintainability, and separation of concerns.

## Purpose

The packages in this directory serve several important purposes:

- Provide reusable functionality across different parts of the application
- Encapsulate complex logic into maintainable, testable modules
- Enable independent versioning and deployment of components
- Facilitate collaboration between different development teams
- Support integration with external systems and libraries

## Structure

The packages directory should contain well-defined, self-contained packages that follow a consistent structure:

```
packages/
├── package-name/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── module1.py
│   ├── module2.py
│   ├── tests/
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   ├── test_module1.py
│   │   └── test_module2.py
│   ├── setup.py
│   └── README.md
└── another-package/
    ├── ...
```

## Development

### Creating a New Package

To create a new package:

1. Create a new directory with a descriptive name
2. Initialize the package structure with necessary files
3. Implement the package functionality
4. Write comprehensive tests
5. Create a setup.py file for installation
6. Document the package API and usage

### Package Guidelines

When developing packages:

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each package should have a clear, focused purpose
2. **API Design**: Design clean, intuitive APIs with proper documentation
3. **Dependencies**: Minimize external dependencies to reduce complexity
4. **Testing**: Achieve high test coverage for all package functionality
5. **Documentation**: Include comprehensive documentation for all public interfaces
6. **Versioning**: Follow semantic versioning for package releases

## Installation

Packages can be installed in development mode for local development:

```bash
# From the package directory
pip install -e .
```

Or installed from the repository for use in other projects:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/username/fluxora.git#subdirectory=packages/package-name
```

## Testing

To run tests for a specific package:

```bash
# From the package directory
pytest
```

## Integration with Other Components

The packages directory integrates with:

- **Src**: For core application functionality
- **Apps**: For application-specific implementations
- **Backend**: For server-side functionality
- **Mobile/Web Frontend**: For client-side functionality

## Best Practices

When working with packages:

1. **Documentation**: Document all public APIs thoroughly
2. **Backward Compatibility**: Maintain backward compatibility when updating packages
3. **Deprecation Policy**: Follow a clear deprecation policy for API changes
4. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling and reporting
5. **Performance**: Consider performance implications of package design
